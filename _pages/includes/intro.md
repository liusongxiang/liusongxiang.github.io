I received the Ph.D. degree from the Human-Computer Communications Laboratory (HCCL) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), Hong Kong SAR, China, in 2021, supervised by [Prof. Helen Meng](http://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-meng-mei-ling-helen/). Before that, I obtained the B.Eng. degree in Automation from Department of Control Science and Engineering at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). 
I did a 3-month summer visiting in 2019 at Speech Processing and Machine Learning Lab at National Taiwan University, advised by [Prof. Hung-yi Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DxLO11IAAAAJ&hl=en), working on adversarial attacks on ASVspoofing countermeasure systems and unsupervised ASR using GAN-based models.

My research interests encompass the extensive domain of speech and language intelligence, which includes speech foundation models, large language models (LLMs), text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), voice conversion (VC), singing synthesis, cross-modal representation learning, audio adversarial attacks \& defense, among other related areas.
